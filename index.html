<!--Introduction (this is where you can edit the text directly)-->

<div class= "pink1"> <!--Calling on the stylesheet to use the div class pink1, as defined in the sheet.-->

<!--Quick rundown of what this stuff means:--> 
<!--<br> is for linebreak-->
<!--<b> word </b> is for bolded text, <i> word </i> is for italics-->
<!--<a href="link"> word </a> is for pasting links and displaying it using text-->
<!--<h1>, <h2>, <p>, etc. are the font size, as dictated by the stylesheet and can be adjusted there-->
<!--<center> is a deprecated feature, meaning it no longer has active support. It still works, but if there's a weird bug involving it it will not be fixed. It'll yell at you about it but it's fineeeeeeeeeee. Used for centering text-->

<br> <h1><center>Welcome to the Valesite!</center></h1>

<br> <p> Hello all the kings, queens and everything in betweens viewing this site, my name's Vale and this is my place for me to put all the stuff I want to keep track of, such as socials and art and whatnot.
<br> <br> A bit of info about myself: I'm an 18 year old transfem from the United States (unfortunately) who is obsessed with a $4 cube game and a $60 squid game (both of which I have like 3k hours on technically) and I also dabble in art (although not very good art)
